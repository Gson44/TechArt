# Tech ART

Tech ART is a site I created to show case my work. As of right now I be showing some of the stuff I been working on in music, 3d modeling, and drawing. The purpose as of right now is to showcase my work but maybe I can implement more feature so other can showcase their work. I am a person who enjoy creativy and building new things. I enjoy playing guitar, writing codes, building application, and drawing.
